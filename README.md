# tmux-hackernews
Allows display of periodically updating Hackernews headlines in tmux statusbar.

## Installation
### Tmux Plugin Manager
If you're using Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), add this line to your `.tmux.conf`
file in your plugin list:

    set -g @plugin 'teolandon/tmux-hackernews'

Then use `Prefix + I` to install it.

### Manual Installation
Clone this repository using git:

    git clone htpps://github.com/teolandon/tmux-hackernews ~/path/to/plugin

Of course, substituting `~/path/to/plugin` with whatever path you want to store
this plugin in.

Then, add this line at the end of your `.tmux.conf`:

    run-shell ~/path/to/plugin/hackernews.tmux

Again, substitue the path with your desired path. Reload your `.tmux.conf` or
restart the tmux server, and the plugin should be active. To reload your
`.tmux.conf` use

    tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

or wherever your tmux config file is located at.

## Usage and formatting
### Usage
Include the format string `#{headline}` somewhere in status-right or
status-left, and they should render as the current headline. Example:

```
# This is in .tmux.conf
set -g status-right ' #{headline} | %d/$m | %H:%M:%S '
```

This will display the headline next to date and time, without any formatting.

If a headline is particularly interesting, use `Prefix + h` to open it up in
your selected browser.

### Formatting
The headline format string should be substituted by a headline from
[Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com). Headlines are cut off at a
character limit specified in the tmux user option `@hackernews-max-chars`.

Headlines to be shown are picked from the current top 30 stories in the
frontpage every 2 hours by default, and cycle around until new ones get pulled,
meaning that the displayed headline increments every 4 minutes.

## Customization
`tmux-hackernews` uses tmux user options as customization variables. Simply set
them to what you want in your `.tmux.conf` file. For example, if you want to set
`@var-name` to `var-value`, write this:

    set -g @var-name 'var-value'

### List of variables
* `@hackernews-browser` - Choose your browser by editing this variable. The
  plugin assumes that your browser takes a URL as a single argument and opens
  it up in a new tab. If your browser needs an option to open the tab in your
  liking, you should add the option, it will be considered. If you need options
  *after* the url, then leave an issue and I will look into implementing that.
  Defaults to xdg-open.
* `@hackernews-max-chars` - Specify the maximum character width you desire the
  headline field to take. Any headlines longer than this character width will
  be truncated with three dots in the end. Fixed width and dynamic width options
  might be implemented in a future update. Defaults to 80.
* `@hackernews-scroll` - Enables scroll keybinds when set to 'true', disables
  them when unset or set to anything else.
* `@hackernews-period` - Custom period for the 30 headlines to be scrolled
  through. In hours. Several hour values will miss out on the last few
  headlines, and will act weirdly when passing midnight, due to bash not being
  able to work with float numbers, and I'm not currently interested in
  implementing a fix.

## Keybinds
### Main
- `Prefix + h` opens up the link to the current headline on your system's
  browser.

### Optional
These keybinds are enabled by setting the tmux option `@hackernews-scroll` to
'true'.

- `Prefix + >` shows the next headline.

- `Prefix + <` shows the previous headline.

Let me know if there are any conflicts with other popular tmux plugins.

## Planned Features
* Switch from curl-ing the whole website to using the API. Will possibly allow
  for easy implementation of more than 30 headlines.
* Pulling headlines from other news sites or at least pages of ycombinator.
* Got any new ideas for features? Leave them as an enhancement in the Issues
  page!

## Credits
This plugin is heavily inspired and modeled after
[tmux-battery](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery).

## TODO
* Figure out if you can retroactively apply release versions on github.
* Keep updating!
