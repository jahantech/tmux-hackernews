# tmux-hackernews
Allows display of periodically updating Hackernews headlines in tmux statusbar.

## Installation
### Tmux Plugin Manager
If you're using Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), add this line to your `.tmux.conf` file in your plugin list:

    set -g @plugin 'teolandon/tmux-hackernews'

Then use `Prefix + I` to install it.

### Manual Installation
Clone this repository using git:

    git clone htpps://github.com/teolandon/tmux-hackernews ~/path/to/plugin

Of course, substituting `~/path/to/plugin` with whatever path you want to store this plugin in.

Then, add this line at the end of your `.tmux.conf`:

    run-shell ~/path/to/plugin/hackernews.tmux

Again, substitue the path with your desired path. Reload your `.tmux.conf` or restart the tmux server, and the plugin should be active. To reload your `.tmux.conf` use

    tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

or wherever your tmux config file is located at.

## Usage and formatting
### Usage
Include the format string `${headline}` somewhere in status-right or status-left, and they should render as the current headline. Example:

```
# This is in .tmux.conf
set -g status-right ' #{headline} | %d/$m | %H:%M:%S '
```

### Formatting
The headline format string should be substituted by a headline from [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com). Headlines are cut off at a character limit specified in the file `vars.conf`, under the variable `max_chars`. Headlines to be shown are picked from the current top 30 stories in the frontpage, and cycle around in a period of 2 hours, meaning that the displayed headline increments every 4 minutes. Customization will be included in a future update.

## Customization
In order to customize the plugin to your liking, you have to navigate to its directory (`~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-hackernews/` if you used TPM), and edit the `vars.conf` file.

List of variables:
 * `browser` - Choose your browser by editing this variable. Simply enter the name of your browser as you would enter it in a terminal window. The plugin assumes that your browser takes a URL as an argument and opens it up in a new tab. Default browser is w3m, since it's terminal based, so it will work for people using tmux for ssh sessions, while it is also included in a lot of systems.
 * `max_chars` - Specify the maximum character width you desire the headline field to take. Any headlines longer than this character width will be truncated with three dots in the end. Fixed width and dynamic width options might be implemented in a future update.

## Keybinds
`Prefix + >` shows the next headline.

`Prefix + <` shows the previous headline.

`Prefix + h` opens up a new tmux window with the current article displayed using the browser program specified in `vars.conf`, under the variable `browser`.

## Planned Features
 * Switch from curl-ing the whole website to using the API. Will possibly allow for easy implementation of more than 30 headlines.
 * Pulling headlines from other news sites or at least pages of ycombinator.
 * Cache whole list of headlines, so that the list doesn't update while the script cycles through it (causes duplicates). Possibly with a refresh keybind.
 * Got any new ideas for features? Leave them as an Issue in the Issues page!

## Credits
This plugin is heavily inspired and modeled after [tmux-battery](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery).

## TODO
 * Acquire permission to model this file after the tmux-battery README.
 * Add **Customization** section in this README.
